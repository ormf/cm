<h1>Filtering and Delay</h1>

<h3>Digital Filtering</h3>

<p>
A filters boosts or reduces (attenuates) the amplitude of certain
frequencies in a signal.  Several types of filters are commonly used
in audio processing:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A <i>low-pass</i> filter attenuates higher frequency components
relative to lower ones.
</li>
<li>
A <i>high-pass</i> filter attenuates lower frequency components
relative to higher ones.  </li>
<li>
A <i>band-pass</i> filter passes a range of frequency components
through and attenuates the rest.  The pass range is ususally described
in terms of a <i>center frequency</i> and a <i>bandwidth</i>.
</li>
<li>
A <i>band-reject</i> filter rejects a range of frequency components
and allows the others to pass through.</li> <li>A <i>comb</i> filter
alloes multiple frequency ranges to pass through and attenuates the
rest.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The portion of the spectrum that the filter does not attenuate is
called the <em>pass band</em> of the filter. The portion that is
attenuated (or not boosted) is called the <em>stop band</em>.  In a
perfect world the pass band and the stop band of a filter would be
sharply delimited, but in fact filters always <em>transition</em> from
one band to the other. Some point along this transition curve is
designated to be the <em>cutoff frequency</em>, the point in the
spectrum at which the signal's power has been reduced to half its
value, or -3 dB.  The half-power cutoff value is sometime expressed as
a .707 amplitude value (since power ranges with the square of the
amplitude, .707^2 = .5 = half-power attenuation).
</p>

<p>
The perceived effect of a filter will vary greatly depending on the
spectrum of the input signal.  For example, applying a low-pass filter
to a signal with no high frequencies will have no percievable
effect. The natural freuency of a comb filter will not "ring" if the
signal does not contain components near that frequency.  In order to
work effectivly with filters the composer must first understand the
spectral makeup of the input signal and then be prepared to experiment
with various filter parameters to achieve optimal results.
</p>

</p>
<img align="middle" alt="[filt1.jpg]" src="filt1.jpg">
</div>

<p>
A band-pass filter has <em>two</em> cutoff frequencies, one on either
side of a single pass band whose characteristices are determined by
the filter's <i>center frquenency</i> and <i>bandwidth</i>.  The ratio
of the center frequency to the bandwidth is called the <i>filter Q</i>
and determines how resonant the filter is around the center
frequency. A filter with a high Q is tightly focused and will
resonate, or "ring" near the center frequency more than a filter with
a low Q.  Band-pass filters also have a <i>gain</i> factor that
determines the total amplitude of the resonance. The gain on a filter
that employs a <i>feedback loop</i> (a comb filter, for examnple) must
always be less than 1.0 or else filter's output will eventually
overflow and cause distortion in the output signal.
</p>

<h3>Filter Response Time</h3>

<p>
A filter works by controlling the rate of change between samples of
the signal passing through it.  Higher frequencies have faster rates
of change than lower ones which means that the <em>slope</em> or
differences between sample values are larger for higher frequency than
for slower frequencies.

If a filter only permits a certain maximum rate of change to flow
through then the amplitudes of the output samples will be altered for
any rates above that limit in the input signal.  This affects the
spectrum because the maximum rate of change the filter allows
determines the maximum slopes that output waveforms can possess.  The
cutoff frequnecy determimes the maximum slope that the filter.  All
filters have a time response that is <em>inversly proportinoal</em> to
the "width" of the filter in the frequency domain.  That is, if the
filter is exact, or sharp, in the frequency domain then is inexact in
the time domain: the more narrow the filter, the longer it will
"ring".  The more "narrow" the filter the lesser the rate of change,
which means that the "amplitude envelope" of the output signal will
vary more slowly over time.


</p><h3>Frequency and Impulse Response</h3>

A graph such as the one shown in Example 1 is called an <i>amplitude
vs frequency response curve</i>, it depicts the effects of a filter
in the frequency domain.  Every type filter has its own characterisitc
freqeuncy reponse curve and the names of the most common filter types
(low-pass, comb, etc) indicate the general shape of their response.
To measure frequency response an input signal of white noise is used


because white noise contains all 
frequencies at equal ampliutudes thus allowing the effects of the filter on the ouput spectrum 
to be visible over the entire frequency range.

<p>
The <i>impulse response</i> (IR) of a filter is a measurement of the
output signal's amplitude in the time domain. To observe the inpulse
response a single sample containing all frequencys at maximum
amplitude, called the <i>unit impulse</i> is input into the filter and
the output signal is measured over time.  According to Fourier's
theorem, a single frequency, or sine wave, has infinite
duration. Shorter signals may be created by adding sine waves together
such that they cancel out at a certain points to create signals of a
specific duration. The shorter a signal's duration, the more sine
waves must be added together, and hence, the wider its spectrum. In
the digital domain a one sample signal contains all the frequencies
below the Nyqiust limit.
<!-- Some filters have a very short (local) time effect.Other filters that involing feedback loops may have very long impulse responsetimes. -->


</p><h3>Digital filter descriptions</h3>

<p>
A <i>digital filter</i> is an algorithm whose output spectrum differs
from its input stream. Since just about the only requirement for a
filter is that it operate on inputs and outputs almost any piece of
software can be considered to be a filter!  This includes many common
processing effects such as delay, chorus, flanging and reverberation.
</p>

<p>
Digital filtering is performed on a series of <i>indexed
samples</i>. For example, for an input signal <var>x</var>
then <var>x(n)</var> would denote the current input sample
and <var>x(n-1)</var> references thee last (previous) input
sample. The <em>filter order</em> indicates how many past values
involved in the calculation of an output sample. Filter equations are
typically expressed as a series of indexed samples that are added,
subtracted and scaled by <i>filter coefficients</i>.  Sample terms can
reference the input or the output signal of the filter. In filter
descriptions the input signal is often named <var>x</var>
while <var>y</var> is used to designate the output signal. Filter
coefficients are named in a simiar manner: <tt>a</tt> coeffients are
applied to the input signal and <tt>b</tt> coefficients apply to the
output signal.
</p>

<p>
An filter that references only input terms in the calculation of the
output signal is called a <i>feed-forward</i> filter.  Such filters
are also called <i>finite impules response</i> (FIR) filters because
their impulse reponse is guaranteed to reach zero after a finite
period of time.
</p>

<p>
If a filter references past output values in its calculation of the
next output it is called a <i>recursive</i>, or <i>feed-backward</i>
filter. Such filters have an <i>infinite impulse response</i> (IIR)
because the output may never reach zero. In fact, the <i>gain</i>
factor for an IIR filters must always be less then 1.0 or else the
filter will produce amplitude overflow at some point.  IIR filters can
produce sharp, exponentially shaped response curves. Their drawback is
that the recursivce "memory" can produce a ringing sound on
transients.
</p>

<p>
As an example of a simple digital filter consider the following
equation for an averaging low-pass filter:
</p>

<blockquote> <pre>y(n) = .5*x(n) + .5*x(n-1)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This equation implements a low pass filter because averaging has a
greater effect on numbers with high rates of change than on numbers
with a low rate of change. For example, if .4 and .6 are averaged the
result is .5, a value close to both input numbers.  However, .1 and .9
also average to .5 but output value is not close to either input.  The
equation "smoothes out" larger rates of change much more than smaller
ones.
</p>

<p>
A more general description of the low-pass filter shown above is:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <code>y(n) = a0*x(n) + a1*x(n-1)</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
where <var>a0</var> and <var>a1</var> are <em>coefficients</em>, or
scalars, on the input signal. We can use these same terms and
coefficients to describe a high-pass filter:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <code>y(n)= a0*x(n) - a1*x(n-1)</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
This example acts as a high-pass filter because subtraction has more
effect on values close to one another than on values with higher rates
of change.  For example the input samples .4 and .6 become .2 in the
output, while the inputs .9 and .1 produce .8 as the output.
</p>

<h3>Filtering in CLM</h3>

<p>
CLM provides a number of different CLM generators related to
filtering. The most basic of these is the
<a href="clm.html#make-one-zero">one-zero,</a> generator, whose equation is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code> y(n) = a0 x(n) + a1 x(n-1)</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that by providing different coefficients the one-zero generator
can implement both the low-pass and high-pass examples discussed in
the previous section. We can demonstrate this by designing a little
instrument that uses one-zero to filter a noisy input signal:
</p>

<div class="float">
<p class="captxt">
<span class="floatlabel">
<a href="filt.ins">filt.ins</a></span> A simple noise filtering instrument.
</p>
<pre class="code">(definstrument filt-noise (start dur amp a0 a1)
  (let* ((beg (seconds->samples start))
         (end (+ beg (seconds->samples dur)))
         (flt (make-one-zero :a0 a0 :a1 a1))
         (noi (make-rand-interp :frequency (* .5 *srate*))))
    (run 
      (loop for i from beg to end
            do (outa i (* amp (one-zero flt (rand-interp noi))))))))</pre>
</div>

<p>
If the <var>a1</var> coefficient is 0 then no filtering occurs. If
 <var>a0</var> and <var>a1</var> are less than 1.0 then low-pass
filtering is described, if <var>a1</var> is less than 0.0
then <code>filt-noise</code> performs high-pass filtering.
</p>

We can use <code>envelope-&gt;coeffs</code> and a FIR filter to place
an arbitrary frequency response envelope on a sound source:

<h2>Delay</h2> <p>

When a signal is delayed it is only mixed into the output after first
waiting a specified period of time.  In a typical delay line
a <i>feedback loop</i> is used to reroute a portion of the delayed
signal back into the delay again, which provides an efficient
mechanism for implementing multiple delays of the same material.  The
feedback process is controlled by a gain factor that attenenuates the
signal each time it is delayed.  The speed at which the signal
attenuates depends both on the gain and the delay time.  A gain factor
less than 1.0 causes the delayed material to diminsih in amplitude
over time until its effect dissapears into the background noise. Gains
greater than 1.0 will cause the signal's amplitude to become unstable
and overflow at some point.

</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
Delays are implemented using <i>delay-lines</i>.  A delay-line is a
buffer of length <i>n</i> samples into which a signal flows and then
reappears <i>n</i> sample periods later.  Each time a sample is input
into the delay-line it "pushes" the current contents in the line one
more location toward the end.  Since input and output from the delay
line happens each sample period it takes n/srate seconds for a delayed
sample to reappear.  One can determine the delay-line length needed to
produce a particular delay time by multiplying the sampling rate by
the delay time.  The function <tt>seconds-&gt;samples</tt> can be used
to convert time to a delay line length.  The
function <tt>keynum-&gt;samples</tt> (delaysnd.ins) converts a keynum
or note name into its period length (in samples) for tuning the
"natural frequency" of the delay line.
<p>


As of yet we have considered reading samples from the end of the
delay-line.  But in reality a sample can be read from any location
along a delay-line.  Reading samples from a delay-line is
called <i>tapping</i>, and the positions in the delay-line from which
samples are read are called <i>taps</i>.  The closer a tap is to the
front of the delay-line the less delay time will have occured when the
signal reaches that tap position.  By using a moveable tap a single
delay-line can represent a variety of delays at the same time. This is
called <i>variable length delay</i>.  By "sweeping" a tap between a
minimum and maxumum delay length the delay-time will evolve over time
as the distance of the tap grows and shrinks.  The sweeping mation can
be controlled by an envelope or by a <i>low frequency oscillator</i>,
or LFO.

</p><h3>Comb Filtering</h3>
The <i>comb filter</i> is a simple recirculating delay line with gain control
on the feedback term. The inpulse response of a comb filter is a train of pulses spaced the length of
the delay line apart in time. Because this impulse is periodic the comb filter is said to have
a frequency. This frequency is called the <i>natural frequency</i> of the comb filter
and is equal to the sampling rate divided by the length of the delay line.
For example, the natural
frequency of a .001 second delay is 1/.001 or 1000 Hertz, which at a sampling rate of 44100
corresonds to a delay-line length of 4410 samples.
The characteristic of the comb filter is to emphasize multiples of the natural frequency  and
to attenute other frequencies due to phase-cancellation from the feedback loop. This 
phase-cancellation at multples of the natural frequency creates the characteristic
"notches" in the frequency response that resemble the teeth of a comb.
<p>
</p><center><img alt="[flanger-f2.gif]" src="flanger-f2.gif"></center>

With a variable length delay line, the emphasised frequencies of the comb 
filter can change during the course of a computed soundfile, causing frequency 
`sweeps'. The following instrument is identical to the previous comb-filter 
instrument except that the delay line length (tap location) is controlled by

<p>

</p><h3>Flanging</h3>
<p>
The <i>flange</i> effect occurs when a signal is added to a slightly
delayed version of itself. Typical delay times for flanging
are between 1 to 10 milliseconds.  To flange the signal the amount of delay 
is made to oscillate between a minimum and maximum length at slow rate
 called the flange rate
Modulation can be implemented by an oscillator generating a sinewave or
triangle wave at a low frequency.  Because delay time in flanging are so short 
no "echo effect" in the delay is heard. Instead, flanging produces
a filtered "whooshing" sound  that is caused by phase cancellation
brought about by  the feeback in the signal.  As is the
case with the comb filter the frequency respose of a flanger is a series
of notches in the spectrum.





The first example has a flange delay of 1-5 millisecond and 
a flange rate of .25 herz. The second example creates a noise
using a high flange rate. The third example uses longer delays
of 30-50 millisecond and no feedback to create a chorus effect.

<h3>Convolution</h3>

<p>
Convolution is the "cross-product" result of mutiplying every sample
of a source sound by every sample of a filtering sound.  This
effectively adds the charactistics of the "filter" sound to the
source. To see why this is so, consider what happens when you clap
your hands in a reverberant environment. A very short handclap serves
as an <em>impulse</em> into the reverberant surroundings.  If you were
to graph that inpulse over time, it might look something like this:
</p>

<div class="float">
<p class="captxt">
<span class="floatlabel">Example n.</span>
Impulse response of a reverberant  room.

</div>

<p>
Givin an initial inpulse there is a build-up of sound "density" at the
beginning followed by a smooth decay toward zero.  In the digital
domain, it's easy to realize that each sample point of the response
can be viewed as a discrete echo of the impulse. Since, ideally, the
impulse is a single non-zero sample, it's not a stretch to realize
that a series of samples -- a sound played in the room -- —would be the sum
of the responses of each individual sample at their respective times
</p?

<p>
In other words, if we have a digitized impulse response, we can easily
add that exact room characteristic to any digitized dry
sound. Multiplying each point of the impulse response by the amplitude
of a sample yields the room's response to that sample; we simply do
that for each sample of the sound that we want to "place" into that
room. This yields a bunch -- as many as we have samples -- of overlapping
responses that we simply add together.

Unfortunately, convolution is extremely expensive computationally if
it is done by "brute force" multiplication and addition.  Since each
sample of the input is multiplied individually by each sample of the
impulse response and then added to the mix, then if we have n samples
to process, and the impulse response is m samples long, we need to
perform n+m multiplications and additions. So, if the impulse response
is three seconds (a big room), and we need to process one minute of
music, we need to do about 350 trillion multiplications and the same
number of additions (assuming a 44.1KHz sampling rate).
